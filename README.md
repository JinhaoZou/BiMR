# BiMR
Simulation code for bidirectional Mendelian Randomization model     
This is the 1.0 version of the BiMR simulation code     
Main simulation code are in the folder R/     


## Overview

After load all functions
Perform one simulation with bidirectional MR model:
  <html>
  <body>
  <p> Sim_one(n_sim = 5, causal = "bi_infi", method = "all")</p>
  </body>
  </html>


Perform one simulation with unidirectional MR model:
  Sim_one(n_sim = 5, causal = "uni", method = "all")
