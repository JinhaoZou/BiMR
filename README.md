# BiMR
Simulation code for bidirectional Mendelian Randomization model         
This is the 1.0 version of the BiMR simulation code          
Simulation code are in the folder R/            
You can install in by using code:         
`library(devtools)`     
`install_github("JinhaoZou/BiMR")`  

## Overview
Other required packages can be installed through      
`install.packages("MendelianRandomization")`     
`install.packages("ivmodel")`      
Before run the code, packages should be load             
`library(MendelianRandomization)`       
`library(ivmodel)`        

There are major three functions: 
- Data.R, a function to generate simulated data
    -  Example: `Data(causal = "uni")`
-
